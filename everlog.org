1.系统拼音的快捷键: C+\,input chinese-py
2.使用Gnus GMAIL: [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GnusGmail][Emacs Wiki]],(C-c L,插入网络链接),when I made the configture as the Wiki said, she can receive my gmail,but she can't send the gmail,it puzzles me a lot, why?
when I opend the init.el, I found that she added some code below is the details:
#+BEGIN_SRC 
(custom-set-variables
 ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.
 ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
 ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
 ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
'(send-mail-function (quote mailclient-send-it)))
(custom-set-faces
 ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom.
 ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
 ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
 ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
 )
#+END_SRC
so she use the mailclient-send-it to push the mail as default, so I just comment it,and add the code below so as to start the mail to send for me:
'(send-mail-function (quote smtpmail-send-it)))
